# 🏠 Homely: A Transparent Home Valuation Tool

Welcome to **Homely**, a home valuation dashboard built by data scientists from the UC Berkeley MIDS program — Louis Young, Qiong Zhang, and Mohammed Elaubeir.

Our tool is designed to empower buyers, sellers, and homeowners by providing **transparent insights** into what affects a home's value and **why**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Make home pricing **clear, fair, and interactive**
- Break down how individual features **contribute to home value**
- Enable users to explore **“what-if” scenarios** and compare neighborhoods
- Build trust in property valuation by avoiding black-box models
