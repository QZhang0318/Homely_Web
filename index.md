# Homely: A Transparent Home Valuation Tool

Welcome to **Homely**, a home valuation dashboard built by data scientists from the UC Berkeley MIDS program — Louis Young, Qiong Zhang, and Mohammed Elaubeir.

Our tool is designed to empower buyers, sellers, and homeowners by providing **transparent insights** into what affects a home's value and **why**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Make home pricing **clear, fair, and interactive**
- Break down how individual features **contribute to home value**
- Enable users to explore **“what-if” scenarios** and compare neighborhoods
- Build trust in property valuation by avoiding black-box models

---

## 👥 Intended Audience

- First-time home buyers  
- Real estate investors  
- Homeowners evaluating potential renovations or sales

---

## 📊 Data Sources

Our project focuses on **Los Angeles County** and integrates over 25 features from public and proprietary sources:

- LA County Assessor’s Office  
- OpenStreetMap & Google Places  
- Census Bureau & Zillow  
- Environmental, educational, and recreational datasets
